# 🚀 Azure Data Engineering Project – End-to-End Data Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline** built on **Microsoft Azure**.  
The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization, enabling **scalable analytics and business decision-making**.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png) <!-- You can replace with actual diagram -->

1. **Data Source**  
   - Data ingested from **GitHub (variable URLs)**.  

2. **Data Ingestion**  
   - **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** orchestrates ingestion of raw data into **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  

3. **Raw Data Store**  
   - Data is stored in **Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Raw Layer)**.  

4. **Data Transformation**  
   - **Azure Databricks (PySpark)** used for data cleansing, validation, and transformation.  
   - Transformed data is stored back into **Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Transformed Layer)**.  

5. **Serving Layer**  
   - **Azure Synapse Analytics** used for querying, modeling, and preparing datasets for reporting.  
   - **SQL Views** created in Synapse to efficiently extract curated data from the transformed layer.  

6. **Reporting & Visualization**  
   - **Power BI** dashboards built on Synapse provide **charts, KPIs, and actionable insights** for decision-making.

## 🔑 Features
- End-to-end **ETL/ELT pipeline** with Azure.  
- **Scalable ingestion** using Azure Data Factory.  
- **Big Data processing** with Databricks (PySpark).  
- **Optimized querying** with Azure Synapse SQL & Views.  
- **Business intelligence** with Power BI interactive dashboards.  
- Handles **schema evolution & pipeline automation**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Azure Data Factory** – Data Orchestration & Ingestion  
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** – Data Storage (Raw & Transformed)  
- **Azure Databricks (PySpark)** – Data Transformation  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL, Views)** – Serving & Querying  
- **Power BI** – Data Visualization & Reporting  
- **GitHub** – Data Source  

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases
- Automating ingestion of external datasets into a secure data lake.  
- Creating a **curated data warehouse layer** with SQL Views in Synapse.  
- Delivering **real-time dashboards** for stakeholders in Power BI.  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Ingestion**: Configure Azure Data Factory pipeline with GitHub dataset URLs.  
2. **Transformation**: Use Azure Databricks notebook (PySpark) for data cleaning & transformation.  
3. **Serving**: Load processed data into Synapse and define SQL Views.  
4. **Reporting**: Connect Synapse to Power BI and create interactive dashboards.  

---

## 📌 Outcome
- Reduced manual reporting effort with **automated pipelines**.  
- Delivered **insightful dashboards** in Power BI.  
- Showcased **end-to-end Data Engineering best practices** in Azure.
